## Overview

The sizing behavior will be the following:

When ggiraph object is printed from rstudio, it should be displayed in the viewer or in an external brower. 

* If displayed in RStudio viewer, the ggiraph object will automatically scale to an optimum dimension to make sure the whole graphic can be seen without scrooling. 
* If displayed in a modern browser, the ggiraph object will scale to an optimum width but if the ratio width and height is less 1.00, scrooling will be necessary. 
* *Note that argument `width` (we will talk about it later) won't have any effect.*
    
When ggiraph object is printed within an `Rmd` document, the ggiraph object will scale to an optimum width. Argument `width` can be used to control the maximum width of the graph in the web page: `width=1` will use the whole available width space and `width=.7` will use the 70% of the available width.

When ggiraph object is printed within a shiny application, the ggiraph object will scale to an optimum dimension to make sure the whole graphic can be seen without scrooling. Argument `width` can be used to control the maximum size of the graph in the responsive component. Arguments `width` and `height` of `ggiraphOutput` have no effects. 

When ggiraph object is printed within a flexdashboard document, **argument `flexdashboard` will have to be set to TRUE**, it will make sure the whole graphic fits the box used as container. If `flexdashboard` is set to FALSE, the ggiraph object will not be correctly sized within the box. 

*If `flexdashboard` is set to TRUE accidentally in a non flexdashboard document, the graphic will not be displayed.*

## Examples

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggiraph)

gg_point = ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = drat, color = disp) ) +
  geom_point() + theme_minimal()

ggiraph(code = {print(gg_point)}, zoom_max = 1, width = 0.25)
ggiraph(code = {print(gg_point)}, zoom_max = 1, width = 0.50)
ggiraph(code = {print(gg_point)}, zoom_max = 1, width = 0.75)
```

An flexdashboard document example can be found in package folder: `rmd/flexdashboard/flexdashboard.Rmd`.
